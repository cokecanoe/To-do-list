# To-do-list
1st simple project of my coding challenge. a to-do list made from javacsript, html and CSS

# Starting the project
navigate to the backend folder and from the terminal run "node server.js"


# Features
I kept this projects very simple. Using a very simple express server to send a html file over localhost

You can add list items and remove them onve they have been finished. 

Did not want to add a storage because of the simplicity factor of the first project.
